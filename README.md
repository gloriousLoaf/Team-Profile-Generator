## Description
This is a **Node.js CLI** that prompts the user through the creation of a fully-styled and functional employee directory in the form of an HTML page to launch in the browser. This project relies on [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer "Inquirer.js at npmjs.org").
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Installation
Clone this repository and run it locally from the command line.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Usage
To get started in your command line:
```bash
npm i
node app
```
Then answer all the Inquirer prompts. After you have entered all your team members, the app will log your team and create the directory. Check the "output" folder for **team.html** file.
